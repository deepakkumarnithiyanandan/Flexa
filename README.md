Flexa: Decentralized Lifestyle SUPER-App 🚀
Inspiration 💡
Flexa was born out of the need for a simple yet powerful solution that combines fitness tracking and bill splitting all in one place. The idea was to create a seamless platform where users could easily manage their workout routines while splitting their bills with friends. Whether you're crunching numbers or weights, Flexa has got you covered!

What I Learned 🧠
This project taught me a lot, including:

Streamlit Mastery: Building interactive web apps like a pro!
API Integration: I connected Stripe, Gemini, and Solana for payments, data analysis, and blockchain integration.
Blockchain Power: Interacting with the Solana blockchain for secure data storage was an exciting challenge.
Cloud Deployment: Deploying on Streamlit Cloud gave me insights into cloud-based hosting and app configuration.
How It Works ⚙️
Bill Splitting: Upload a bill image, and let Flexa extract items and split them equally—or customize!
Fitness Tracker: Track your workouts, reps, and calories burned with AI feedback.
Blockchain Integration: Push bill data to Solana blockchain and visualize it in real-time.
Stripe Payments: Process payments between friends for the split bill—all in one app.
Challenges 🏋️‍♂️
OCR Struggles: Extracting data from bills wasn’t perfect, but I made it work!
Blockchain Integration: Learning Solana’s API was a steep climb, but totally worth it.
UI Design: Juggling features without overwhelming the user was tricky but rewarding.
Conclusion 🎉
Flexa is the all-in-one tool you never knew you needed! It blends fitness tracking and bill splitting with cutting-edge tech like AI and blockchain to help you live smarter. I can’t wait to keep improving it and make it even more awesome. 💪
